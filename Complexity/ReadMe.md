## `The Most important if anyone write Coding I prefer them to comment these`
***

## Complaxities are of 2 Types

### 1. Time Complexity ⏲️  &   2. Storage Complexity :memo:

+ What?

```

### `What?`
    [Time Complexity] Whenever you write any code, major role is how much fast it will run.

    [Space Complexity] similar to above we need to even check storage as well

***

### `Why?`
    [Time Complexity] When you give options or done with all things,
     if the application is not running faster or at minimum time then all your burdens are like Ashes (useless).

    [Space Complexity] You written a program where it reads fast by storing lot of data before the requirement.
     some one may say preload data and run it. 
     It's a good Idea but not in all places. and if don't follow grabage collectors then this is totally memory leak and application get crashed.   

***

### `How?`
    It's not just a simple word to Teach here itself for These 2 topics, so i'll be attaching different topics or scenarios where we can check it and avoid it in detailed.
