## `Java Script Basics`

```diff
+ If we start learning anything it should start with basics, there we'll know some Idea of what? it is and why? and how? to use
```

If you see the above description I've added 3 Question Marks, we also call 3Q's ( 3 ??? ).

Which describes and clarifies most of the questions. so, whenever you start anything or in any stage if these 3 questions can answer well means that's it almost 80+ % you're clear.

So, Lets start answering the 3Q's

1. What? <br/>
   1. Js is a programming language (a boring def. but as a rule I'm mentioning).
   2. Js is a set of operations run in Full stack development stage.
      1. What is the meaning of this statement means, It is useful to make an application and in all phases of development we use JS.
         1. ex: Front End - web, application
         2. backend - server side code - Node js, Next js
         3. MERN - express, react, Node - all places JS base
         4. MEAN - same JS based
   3. We'll see the JS in almost all places.
      1. ex: every browser uses JS
      2. Js used to manupulate browser data
      3. JS is the browser controller, handler, manipulater and gives live feel to it with dynamic content updates.
   4. you can add general or boring def to it from google.

2. Why? <br/>
   1. If you see the what properly, we use it almost all places. So we should utilize it properly
   2. I explain first interms of web application. I'm sure most of you don't know these many things we can do and these are ways we can do with it and usage of this.
   3. Next advanced for browser and server side as well
   4. I'll teach some of the real time complexities
   5. I'll teach the ways of optimizations
   6. I'll teach the advanced ways and newer ways with examples 
   7. A complete dir for ECMASCRIPT 
   8. And you can add general definitions to it from google.

3. How? <br/>
   1. Here I focus on 2 things.
      1. Front end - web development usage.
      2. Back end - Rest API's (Node Js), which is the best you can get start and I'll tell the use cases of it which makes you mind blow.


<!-- REST API for built in functions or any calculation functions -->
